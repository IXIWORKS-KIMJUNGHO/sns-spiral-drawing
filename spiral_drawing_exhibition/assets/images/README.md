# Test Image Directory

Place your test image here with the name `ah.jpg` to test the spiral drawing functionality.

If `ah.jpg` is not found, the app will generate a test pattern automatically.

## How to add your test image:
1. Copy your image file to this directory
2. Rename it to `ah.jpg`
3. Run `flutter run -d macos` to test

The app will automatically load and process the image for spiral drawing.
